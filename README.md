# beancount-lima

This is a very early stage Beancount frontend using Steel Scheme and the [Lima parser](https://github.com/tesujimath/beancount-parser-lima).

The observation is that Rust is at the same time both wonderful and uncomfortable for end-users.  The idea is to use Steel Scheme for interactive Beancounting, and later, plugins and scripting.
